# ASP.NET Core Modular Monolith

This repo contains the code used in my blog post about building modular monoliths in ASP.NET Core. If that sounds interesting, have a look at [https://fearofoblivion.com/build-the-modular-monolith-first](https://www.fearofoblivion.com/build-a-modular-monolith-first).

## Getting started

All the code should just work. To run the individual modules, just run `dotnet run` in the corresponding directory under the `src` directory. To run the "host", just start the `FiftyNine.ModularMonolith.Api` project, and it should come up.

Tests? Well, they are there, in _VERY_ simple form! But they do show you how to test the individual modules, as well as the complete "host".
